    "# Programming Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we look into the foundational C# programming concepts, drawing extensively from the resources provided by [*W3Schools*]((https://unitcirclepress.com/)). Additionally, you'll find a selection of practical exercises there to reinforce your understanding and application of these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of this unit, you'll encounter the concept of type casting and you'll more than likely find it's quite straightforward after. \n",
    "\n",
    "In C#, casting are split into two main categories: implicit and explicit casting. Implicit casting is done automatically by the compiler, whereas explicit casting requires manual intervention to specify the type conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implicit Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit casting allows for the automatic conversion of a smaller data type to a larger data type without the risk of data loss. For example, an `int` can be implicitly cast to a long since long can hold all possible values of an `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of how we can use implicit casting, in particular we take a small burger (int) and concert it into a large burger (long). If only that was possible in reality..\n",
    "\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "// implicit casting from int to long\n",
    "int smallBurger = 10;\n",
    "long largeBurger = smallBurger;  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explicit Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit casting, on the other hand, is necessary when converting from a larger data type to a smaller one, or between incompatible types, where there's a potential for data loss. This type of casting requires the desired type to be specified using parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine we are trying to fit a large coffee into a smaller cup. You must be careful, or you'll lose some coffee (data) in the process. This casting requires explicitly specifying the type you're converting to.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "// explicit casting from double to int\n",
    "double largeCoffee = 9.78;\n",
    "int smallCoffee = (int)largeCoffee;  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Conversion Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "For cases where casting between incompatible types is not directly supported, or to convert strings to numeric types and vice versa, C# provides built-in methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "// string to an int\n",
    "string str = \"123\";\n",
    "int num = Convert.ToInt32(str);  \n",
    "\n",
    "// double into a string\n",
    "double pi = 3.14159;\n",
    "string strPi = pi.ToString();  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another set of methods for parsing strings into numbers are the `Parse` and `TryParse` methods, which are available for various numeric types:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "// parses string to int\n",
    "string numberString = \"123\";\n",
    "int result = int.Parse(numberString);  \n",
    "\n",
    "// tries to parse string to int and returns false if conversion fails\n",
    "string invalidNumberString = \"abc\";\n",
    "int parseResult;\n",
    "bool success = int.TryParse(invalidNumberString, out parseResult); \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} When do we use conversion?\n",
    "Often, you won't need to convert types. However, scenarios arise—such as when dealing with user inputs—where conversion becomes indispensable. We will take a look at this when we look at [User Inputs](#user-inputs).\n",
    "```"

    "## User Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Interacting with users through input is a fundamental aspect of many applications. It involves receiving data from users at runtime, which can increase the interactivity and flexibility of your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Input and Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges you might encounter when dealing with user inputs is when your application expects a numeric value, but user input is inherently treated as a string in C#. This discrepancy often leads to a common type conversion error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Cannot implicitly convert type 'string' to 'int'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This error occurs because C# is <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/strongly-typed\">strongly typed</a> and does not automatically convert between types without explicit instruction. Here’s how we can handle such scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you prompt the user for a number, their input comes in as a string. To use this input as a numeric value in your calculations or logic, you must explicitly convert it from string to the appropriate numeric type (int, double, etc.)."

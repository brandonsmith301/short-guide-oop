    "# Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "In C#, exception handling is required to manage unexpected situations arising during program execution. This section of the guide looks at how we can effectively handle errors using the try, catch, and finally keywords. These constructs allow a program to attempt executing a block of code, catch any exceptions that occur if the block fails, and finally, execute cleanup code whether an exception was thrown or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "In C#, exceptions are specialised types that come from the [System.Exception base class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.exception?view=net-8.0). Exceptions provide a structured way to catch errors and react accordingly without stopping the program abruptly under normal circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Errors with Try and Catch\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary way to manage exceptions is by enclosing the code that might cause an error in a try block. This setup allows the program to attempt the execution of code that can potentially fail due to conditions like invalid input, resource constraints, or logical errors. Immediately following the try block, one or more catch blocks can be defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an exception is thrown within the try block and it matches a type specified in a subsequent catch block, that catch block will execute. If the exception doesn't match any catch block, or if there is no catch block at all, the exception escalates up the call stack. If it remains unhandled, it eventually causes the program to terminate, typically resulting in an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "Handling exceptions effectively is very important. Catching exceptions that you cannot properly handle or recover from should generally be avoided. \n",
    "\n",
    "For broad exceptions, such as those deriving directly from `System.Exception`, it is recommended to rethrow them with the throw keyword inside the catch block if they cannot be resolved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rethrowing preserves the stack trace, making debugging easier and allowing higher levels of the program architecture to attempt to handle the exception if appropriate.\n",
    "```"

    "## Types Of Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### NullReferenceException\n",
    "\n",
    "A NullReferenceException occurs when you attempt to access a member on a type that is null.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the scenario below where we declare a list named students but only initialise it if i > 0. This isn't a problem by itself, but it becomes problematic later in the program when we try to add a student's name to the list regardless of whether it was initialised. This results in a NullReferenceException because the list remains null if i is not greater than zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "public class NullReferenceException\n",
    "{\n",
    "   public static void Main(string[] args)\n",

    "   }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling the Exception**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can prevent this type of exception by explicitly initialising the list as null and then checking its status before attempting to use it. This approach safely manages the scenario where a NullReferenceException could occur by ensuring the list is only accessed if it has been properly initialised.\n",

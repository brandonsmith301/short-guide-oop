    "Polymorphism allows related objects to be treated in a similar way, and allows derived classes to redefine how they respond to the same request by overriding the members defined by the base class. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it allows a base class to define a set of members, known as the polymorphic interface, that are available to all of its derived classes. The polymorphic interface can be constructed using any number of [virtual](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/virtual) or [abstract](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/abstract) members.\n",

    "\n",
    "These are methods in a base class that have a default implementation but can be overridden by derived classes. For instance, a virtual CalculateInterest method in an Account class might have a basic implementation, but a SavingsAccount might override it to implement interest calculations specific to savings accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract Members**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike virtual members, abstract members do not provide an implementation. They merely define a method's signature, and it's mandatory for derived classes to provide their own implementations. If the Account class had an abstract GenerateStatement method, each subclass (CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount) would need to implement its own version of how statements are generated and formatted."

    "\n",
    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that aims to simplify complex realities. For instance, consider a person as an object. In the context of a software project, it's not necessary to know every single detail about that person. Instead, you would focus only on the data and tasks that are relevant to your application and the operations you want to perform with that data. This way, abstraction helps to create more manageable and efficient systems by concentrating on essential aspects and ignoring the unnecessary ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "While there are strong similarities between Abstraction and Encapsulation, they really serve different purposes although still complementing each other. Abstraction is about hiding the complexity of the system by exposing just the necessary components, whereas encapsulation is about hiding the internal states and behaviours to protect the integrity of the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a way to create a new class that derives from an existing class, inheriting its features and potentially extending or modifying them. An abstract class is often used as a base class in inheritance hierarchies, but its primary purpose is to outline a template and enforce certain architectural patterns. It dictates not only the structure but also the behaviour of its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal base classes can usually be instantiated on their own, unless they are specifically made abstract. On the otherhand abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly and are designed to only be subclassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a regular base class, methods do not need to be overridden by the subclass. However, in an abstract class, any abstract method must be implemented by the subclass, providing a strict contract that the subclass must adhere to.\n",
    "\n",
    "While all abstract classes can be part of an inheritance hierarchy, not all base classes are abstract. Abstract classes define templates for other classes and prevent direct instantiation, promoting a design that encapsulates a concept without implementing all of its details. Inheritance, more generally, is about extending existing classes and reusing code across a class hierarchy."

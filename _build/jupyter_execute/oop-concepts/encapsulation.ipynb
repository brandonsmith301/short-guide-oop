    "# Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first key concept of object-oriented programming  that we will explore in this guide is encapsulation. Encapsulation is the idea of hiding the implementation details of an object from the user, so that the user only needs to know how to interact with the object, rather than how it works internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is similar to the way that everyday objects are designed to be easy to use. For example, when you turn on a light switch, you don't need to understand the details of the electrical wiring in your walls in order to use the switch. You simply need to know where the switch is located and how to flip it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of encapsulation is protecting an object's data from unauthorised access or modification. To achieve this, an object's state data should be declared using access modifiers such as private, internal, or protected. This ensures that the data can only be accessed or modified through the object's methods, and not directly from outside the object. This prevents accidental or intentional corruption of the data, which can lead to unexpected behaviour or errors in the program. We will explore this concept further in the following sections."

    "## Fundamentals of Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of encapsulation is based on the principle that the data of an object should not be directly accessible from outside the object. Instead, the data is declared as private and can only be modified or accessed indirectly through public methods or properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the importance of encapsulation, let's consider a simple class definition for a car:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "class Car\n",
    "{\n",
    "  public int speed;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the speed field is declared as public, which means that it can be directly accessed and modified from outside the class. However, this can lead to problems, as there is no way to ensure that the value of speed is valid or within a safe range.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code would be allowed by the compiler, even though it sets the speed of the car to an unreasonable and potentially dangerous value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "Car myCar = new Car();\n",
    "myCar.speed = 300;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What we should do instead is declare the speed field as private and provide a public property or method to modify or access the value, which is an example of encapsulation. This means we can add validation logic to ensure that the value of speed is within a safe range:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "class Car\n",
    "{\n",
    "  private int _speed;\n",
    "  public int Speed\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    get => _speed;\n",
    "    set\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      if (value < 0 || value > 100)\n",
    "      {\n",
    "        throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(value), \"Speed must be between 0 and 100\");\n",
    "      }\n",
    "      _speed = value;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this implementation, the Speed property can be used to modify or access the value of _speed, but the validation logic ensures that the value is always within a safe range."

    "## Access Modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move forward, we wanted to just briefly discuss access modifiers which dictate the accessibility of classes, interfaces, and their members. These modifiers help secure a program's internal implementation and expose only necessary components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we provide a table of common access modifiers in C#, however, for further details we recommend you visit the Microsoft documenation on [Access Modifiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common C# Access Modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "| Access Modifier     | Application Scope            | Description |\n",
    "|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| `public`            | Types or type members        | No restrictions; accessible from any part of the program, including other assemblies. |\n",
    "| `private`           | Type members or nested types | Restricted to the containing class or struct, shielding them from external access. |\n",
    "| `protected`         | Type members or nested types | Accessible within the defining class and any derived classes, but not outside these. |\n",
    "| `internal`          | Types or type members        | Limited to the current assembly, though access can be granted to other assemblies. |\n",
    "| `protected internal`| Type members or nested types | Combines `protected` and `internal`: accessible within the assembly and in derived classes. |\n",
    "| `private protected` | Type members or nested types | A mix of `private` and `protected`: accessible only within the defining class and by derived classes within the same assembly. |\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "In C#, the accessibility of type members and types themselves have default default levels. Type members are automatically set to be private, meaning they can only be accessed within the same class. On the other hand, types are set to be internal, which means they can be accessed within the same assembly but not from outside assemblies.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when you define a class in C#, it is automatically set to be internal, and its default constructor is set to be private. However, there are rarely situations where you would want a private class constructor, as it would prevent the creation of objects from that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow other parts of a program to access members of an object or to expose a class to external assemblies, you must explicitly define them with the appropriate access modifiers, such as public or protected.\n",

    "# Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes in object-oriented programming work as templates for creating objects. They define the attributes and methods that objects of that class will have. Each class provides the design from which individual objects are created, meaning you can use a single class definition to instantiate multiple objects. Each object created from the class is an instance of that class and can have its own unique values for the properties defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a very quick illustration, we can use the simple idea of minions from Despicable Me. \n",
    "\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "public class Minion\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string Name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Program\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public static void Main(string[] args)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Minion Bob = new Minion();\n",
    "        Bob.Name = \"Bob\";\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(Bob.Name);\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Minion Stuart = new Minion();\n",
    "        Stuart.Name = \"Stuart\";\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(Stuart.Name);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have defined a template for a minion using a class. This template can then be used to create unique objects, such as Bob and Stuart, who share the same characteristics as other minions. This is a simple example, but minion designs can get more complex. However, you now understand the concept of a class and an object. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a user-defined type that consists of field data, often referred to as member variables, and members that perform operations on this data. These members can include constructors, properties, methods, events, and more. Which we will cover later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, the set of field data represents the \"state\" of a class instance, which is also known as an object. The strength of object-oriented languages like C# lies in their ability to group related data and functionality into a unified class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can define a class in C# using the `class` keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "class Bank\n",
    "{\n",
    "\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined a class type, we can consider what set of member variables to add to represent its state. For example, we might decide that a `Bank` should have the following:\n",
    "- A string data type to represent the bank's name.\n",
    "- A string data type to represent the bank's address.\n",
    "- A list of BankAccount objects to represent the accounts managed by the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our initial design considerations, we can update the Bank class definition to include the following member variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "class Bank\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string Name;\n",
    "    public string Address;\n",
    "    public List<BankAccount> Accounts;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the member variables in our example are declared using the *public* [access modifier](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/access-modifiers). This means that once an object (or instance) of this class type is created using the *new* keyword, these members can be directly accessed and modified. In other words, the object's state can be easily inspected and changed by other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "Data fields of a class should almost never be declared as public. To ensure the security and consistency of your data, it's a much better design approach to define the data as private (or in some cases, protected) and provide access to it through properties (which we'll cover later when looking at encapsulation).\n",

    "# Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows you to create new classes that are built upon existing classes. The existing class is referred to as the base class or parent class, and the new class is called the derived class or child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a derived class inherits from a base class, it automatically gains all the members (fields, properties, methods, and events) of the base class. This means that you can reuse the code from the base class without having to rewrite it in the derived class.\n",
